(ns kotobase.storage.async-contract
  "Reusable Promise-based conformance suite for Worker storage providers.

  The suite this replaces ran eight checks, all sequential, all from one
  writer. That verified the SHAPE of `-compare-and-set-ref!` and nothing
  about its strength: a provider whose store ignores the `If-Match`
  precondition passes every one of those checks, because a single writer
  never observes the difference. It surfaces later as a lost update, with
  no error anywhere.

  So the contract now has two halves. The sequential half is unchanged.
  The concurrent half races writers against the same expected head and
  requires exactly one to win -- the only check that can tell an enforced
  precondition from an ignored one -- and it runs when, and only when, the
  backend declares `:linearizable-ref`. A backend declaring
  `:single-writer-ref` is not asked to pass it, and the result says so by
  name, so a passing run cannot be read as a claim the backend never made."
