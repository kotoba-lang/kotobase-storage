  "Reusable synchronous conformance suite for storage providers.

  Same two halves as `kotobase.storage.async-contract`, and for the same
  reason: a sequential single-writer suite verifies the shape of
  `-compare-and-set-ref!` and nothing about its strength. On the JVM the
  concurrent half uses real threads rather than interleaved promises, so
  it is a stronger test of the same property."

  "Fire `race-width` CAS attempts at the same expected head and collect
   every result.

   `round` keeps a later race's proposals disjoint from an earlier race's
   winner. Without it the writer proposing exactly the current head does a
   no-op publish, leaves `current` equal to `expected`, and a second writer
   then legitimately matches too -- two winners from a correct backend.
   That was a flake in this check, not a finding about any store, and it
   only showed up sometimes because it depended on thread ordering."
