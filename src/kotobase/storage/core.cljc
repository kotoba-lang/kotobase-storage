  loses an update. Every backend must therefore declare exactly one of:

  - `:linearizable-ref` — the CAS is enforced by the store itself, so
    concurrent writers in unrelated processes are safe. Backed by a real
    primitive: an ETag precondition the service evaluates, a SQL
    transaction, `git update-ref`.

  - `:single-writer-ref` — the CAS holds only within one writer. It may be
    serialized in-process, or ride on a transport with no conditional write
    at all (IPNS publishes unconditionally; Backblaze B2 has no conditional
    put on either API). Correct deployments put one writer in front of it,
    or a linearizable ref service.

  The set is closed and the choice is mandatory because the failure mode of
  guessing is silent: an ignored precondition returns success."

;; ── Block-only backends, and composing one with a ref store ─────────────────
;;
;; `IBlockStore` and `IRefStore` were already separate protocols. What was not
;; separable was a BACKEND: `backend?` requires both, so a provider had to
;; serve blocks and refs or be unusable, and `ports` took a single store for
;; both roles.
;;
;; That coupling has a cost with a name. Backblaze B2's S3 API has no
;; conditional PutObject, so its compare-and-set is last-write-wins: two
;; writers starting from the same observed ref are BOTH told they won and the
;; head diverges (kotobase-storage-s3 test/race.cljs reproduces it
;; deterministically). B2 is a fine BLOCK store and an unusable REF store, and
;; before this there was no way to say that -- the choice was all of B2 or none
;; of it.
;;
;; Splitting the backend, not just the protocols, is what lets the two planes
;; be hosted differently: blocks anywhere that can hold immutable bytes
;; (including untrusted, erasure-coded, content-addressed networks), the ref
;; wherever agreement is actually available. See superproject
;; ADR-2607312100 D2.

(def block-profiles
  "WHERE a block physically lives — the question `IBlockStore` never asked.

  `-get-blocks` describes the operation, not the layout, and the layout is
  what a read costs. One object per CID pays one round trip per block; a
  store that packs blocks into CARv2 archives pays one per range. The two are
  different stores with the same protocol, and a caller cannot tell by trying.

  - `:block-per-object` — one immutable object per CID. Every provider that
    existed before 2026-08-16 is this.

  - `:packed-blocks` — blocks live inside CARv2 packs and are fetched by byte
    range. Such a store MUST also declare `:range-read`: without it the only
    possible implementation is to fetch a whole pack to return one block,
    which cuts round trips and multiplies transfer — a failure that reports
    success.

  Superproject ADR-2608160100. Unlike `ref-profiles` this is not yet
  mandatory, because every existing provider predates it and declaring
  nothing must not become a lie about them. **Undeclared is not a default.**
