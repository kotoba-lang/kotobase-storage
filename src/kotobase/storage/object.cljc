  "The large-object plane: bytes too big to move as blocks.

  `IBlockStore` already holds immutable CID-addressed bytes, so the obvious
  question is why a second port exists. Same answer as the block/ref split in
  `kotobase.storage.core`: the operations a caller can rely on are different,
  and the failure mode of guessing is silent.

  - A block is small, fetched in batches, and travels through the process
    that asked for it. A large object is a GB, fetched once, and must NOT
    travel through the process — proxying it is what put a 4 MiB ceiling on
    `PUT /ipfs/:cid` (superproject ADR-2607175000, ADR-2608012600 D4).
  - A block store never deletes; deletion is meaningless for a content
    address. A large-object plane has to answer `git annex drop --from` and
    an LFS quota, which are per-holder lifecycle questions.

  So a provider declares exactly one TRANSFER PROFILE:

  - `:presigned-transfer` — it can hand the client a URL and let the bytes go
    directly to storage. B2/R2 via SigV4.
  - `:proxied-transfer` — the bytes must pass through this process. Embedded
    stores, and anything without a signing key.

  and separately declares whether it can delete at all. A store that cannot
  must say so, because the alternative is a tombstone that reports success
  while the bytes stay readable — which is what `GET /ipfs/:cid` does today."
