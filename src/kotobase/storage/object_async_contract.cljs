(ns kotobase.storage.object-async-contract
  "Promise-based conformance suite for large-object providers.

  `kotobase.storage.object-contract` is synchronous, and that is not a
  stylistic difference -- it makes the presigned profile untestable on the
  runtime that profile exists for. Presigning is HMAC-SHA-256 over a
  canonical request, and on a Worker the only SHA-256 available is
  `crypto.subtle`, which is async. A provider that presigns there returns a
  Promise, `valid-grant?` on a Promise is false, and the sync suite reports a
  conformance failure for a store that is in fact correct. So the only
  provider the sync suite could ever accept as `:presigned-transfer` is one
  that does not need to sign anything -- a fixture.

  Same asymmetry as the sync suite: a proxied store is driven end to end,
  while a presigned store is checked for the properties that have no second
  chance. Completing a presigned upload means talking to the provider's
  network, and that belongs in the provider's own live test.

  Two checks here have no counterpart in the sync suite, both about the same
  hazard -- a grant that constrains nothing:

  - a PUT grant must bind `content-length` **in its signature**;
  - asking for a PUT grant *without* a size must be refused, rather than
    quietly producing an unbound one.

  The second is what closes the door. A provider can satisfy the first by
  binding a size when it is given one, and still hand out a blank cheque to
  every caller that omits it -- which is the caller most likely to be
  streaming an object of unknown length, i.e. exactly the large ones."
