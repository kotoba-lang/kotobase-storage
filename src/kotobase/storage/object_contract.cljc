(ns kotobase.storage.object-contract
  "Reusable conformance suite for large-object providers.

  Same shape as `kotobase.storage.contract`: `check` is `(fn [truthy label])`
  so a provider repo can run it under whatever test runner it has.

  The suite is deliberately asymmetric between the two transfer profiles. A
  proxied store can be driven end to end here; a presigned store cannot,
  because completing an upload means talking to the provider's network. What
  IS checked for a presigned store is the property that has no second chance:
  that a PUT grant binds its size. Everything else about a presigned store
  belongs in that provider's own live test."
  (:require [kotobase.storage.object :as object]))

;; The suite never hashes, so the CIDs are literals — but they are the REAL
;; CIDs of the bytes it stores (sha2-256 of [1 2 3] and of [4 5]), so a
;; provider that does verify content can run this suite unchanged.
