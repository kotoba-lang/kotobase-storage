(ns kotobase.storage.object-id
  "One identity for a large object, and pure conversions to the two Git
  ecosystems that address the same bytes by their own names.

  git-lfs, git-annex and kotobase all carry the SAME digest:

      git-lfs      oid sha256:<hex>              + size
      git-annex    SHA256E-s<size>--<hex>[.ext]
      kotobase     CIDv1(raw, sha2-256)          = 0x01 0x55 0x12 0x20 <hex>

  So the mapping is a pure function in both directions and needs no registry.
  That is the whole reason LFS and annex can share one object plane instead of
  one store each (superproject ADR-2608012600 D1).

  Two configurations break the derivation, and both fail CLOSED here rather
  than resolving to some other object:

  - `chunk=` — every chunk key carries the WHOLE file's hash
    (`SHA256E-s100000-S32768-C1..C4--975cf8…` are all the same digest), which
    is not the sha256 of the chunk's own bytes.
  - client-side encryption — `GPGHMACSHA1--c51589…` is an HMAC, not a content
    hash, and the stored bytes are ciphertext.

  In those two cases the caller must record an explicit binding (the
  `:binding/derivable false` datom in ADR-2608012600 D3). `wire-id->cid`
  returns nil and `require-cid` throws; neither invents a CID.

  Zero dependencies on purpose: this namespace sits under every provider in
  the family, including Worker builds. The base32/multihash arithmetic is
  cross-checked against `io-multiformats` in the test suite (a :test-only
  dependency) so the two implementations cannot drift silently."
