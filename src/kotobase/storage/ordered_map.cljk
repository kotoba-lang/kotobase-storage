  "The OrderedMap contract: what a substrate must SAY before its ranges mean
  the same thing as another's, and the oracle that checks they do.

  An IPLD Map has string keys and no ordered-range API. Prolly trees and
  Merkle-LSM can both present an ordered view over the same logical rows, but
  only once five things are stated, and they are stated differently today:

      comparator   how two encoded keys order
      bounds       whether the upper bound is included
      snapshot     what pins the version being read
      duplicates   which of several versions of one key wins
      tombstones   whether a deletion is absent or present-and-suppressing

  None of these has a default here. That is the same refusal
  `kotobase.storage.core` makes for ref profiles, for the same reason: an
  undeclared profile is an unanswered question, and answering it by guessing
  is wrong silently. A substrate that has not declared cannot be compared,
  and this namespace says so rather than comparing anyway.

  ## The bound disagreement is real, not hypothetical

  Measured 2026-09-06 in this workspace:

      prolly-tree.core/scan-range     (neg? (compare k hi))          k < hi
      kotobase.projection/decode-range (not (pos? (compare k upper))) k <= upper

  Two range APIs over ordered string keys, disagreeing on exactly one row: the
  one whose key equals the upper bound. Handed to an OrderedMap facade that
  took either as \"range\", the boundary row would appear or vanish depending on
  which substrate answered, and nothing in the result would say which had.

  So the canonical logical form here is half-open `[lower, upper)` and an
  inclusive-upper substrate is ADAPTED, explicitly. The adaptation is a filter
  rather than a bound rewrite on purpose: turning `[lo, hi)` into an inclusive
  query needs the predecessor of `hi`, and turning an inclusive `hi` into a
  half-open one needs its successor -- neither exists for arbitrary strings.
  Asking an inclusive substrate for `[lower, upper]` and dropping keys equal
  to `upper` is exact, needs no successor, and costs at most one extra row.

  ## What this namespace does not do

  It does not implement a substrate, and it holds no dependency on one: an
  adapter is a value the caller supplies, so prolly-tree and Merkle-LSM depend
  on this contract and never the reverse. It does not make physical roots
  representation-independent either -- LSM compaction or a rebuilt Prolly tree
  can change index roots while every visible row is identical, so agreement
  found here is agreement about ROWS and is not a claim about CIDs."

  `:lexicographic-utf8` is byte-order over the encoded key. It is the only one

  string, and the encoding must be order-preserving AND reversible. Where it is
  not -- an HMAC-blinded key is the case in this workspace -- lexical order of
  the encoding is not the database's order, and a range over it is not the
