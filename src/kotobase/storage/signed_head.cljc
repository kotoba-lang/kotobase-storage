  "A ref plane that needs no conditional write from its host.

  `:linearizable-ref` backends enforce the compare-and-set themselves, which
  is the strongest thing to have and the least available: Backblaze B2 has no
  conditional put on either API, IPNS publishes unconditionally, and a
  content-addressed or erasure-coded network has nothing to be conditional
  about at all. Requiring one shuts those hosts out of the ref plane entirely.

  This makes the head a SIGNED, SEQUENCED record stored as an ordinary
  immutable block, with a dumb unconditional pointer naming the newest one:

      head/v1 = {ref-name, seq, cid, prev, issuer, sig}

  What that buys, precisely:

  1. **Fork detection.** Two heads at the same `seq` are two heads, and a
     reader can see it. A plain overwritten pointer loses an update with no
     evidence that anything happened.
  2. **Untrusted hosting.** A reader verifies the issuer's signature and the
     sequence itself, so a mirror, CDN or storage node it does not trust can
     serve the ref. This is what lets the block plane and the ref plane live
     on the same untrusted infrastructure.
  3. **The loser learns it lost.** After publishing, the writer re-reads the
     pointer; if the newest head is not its own, it reports `:published?
     false` rather than believing it won.

  What it does NOT buy, and the profile says so: **agreement**. A signature
  proves who issued a head, not that no one else issued another. Two writers
  racing still fork; this makes the fork visible instead of silent. So the
  declared profile is `:single-writer-ref`, and a correct deployment still
  puts one writer in front of it — a Durable Object, an actor, a lease.
  Declaring `:linearizable-ref` here would be exactly the silent-success
  failure `ref-profiles` exists to prevent."

;; ── the same ref plane, for a pointer that answers with a Promise ───────────

;; namespace exists FOR are not: B2, IPNS, S3, a content-addressed network.
;; Each of those is reached over the network, and on the runtime that ships
;; the Worker that means a Promise. So the sync store could not be attached to
;; a single host it was designed for -- the same asymmetry prolly-tree has,
;; where `scan-prefix` grew an async variant and the write path never did.
;;
;; `sign-fn`/`verify-fn` are Promise-returning here too, because Web Crypto has
;; no synchronous signature primitive; that is the same platform split
;; `arrangement`'s `blind-fn`/`encrypt-fn` already carry.
;;
;; The one thing that must not be lost in translation: the write is AWAITED
;; before the re-read. The sync version's correctness rests on reading back
;; what is actually there after publishing, and a `write-head!` whose Promise
;; is dropped would be re-read before it landed -- turning the loser-detects-
;; loss check into a coin flip.
