  "A ref plane that needs no conditional write from its host.

  `:linearizable-ref` backends enforce the compare-and-set themselves, which
  is the strongest thing to have and the least available: Backblaze B2 has no
  conditional put on either API, IPNS publishes unconditionally, and a
  content-addressed or erasure-coded network has nothing to be conditional
  about at all. Requiring one shuts those hosts out of the ref plane entirely.

  This makes the head a SIGNED, SEQUENCED record stored as an ordinary
  immutable block, with a dumb unconditional pointer naming the newest one:

      head/v1 = {ref-name, seq, cid, prev, issuer, sig}

  What that buys, precisely:

  1. **Fork detection.** Two heads at the same `seq` are two heads, and a
     reader can see it. A plain overwritten pointer loses an update with no
     evidence that anything happened.
  2. **Untrusted hosting.** A reader verifies the issuer's signature and the
     sequence itself, so a mirror, CDN or storage node it does not trust can
     serve the ref. This is what lets the block plane and the ref plane live
     on the same untrusted infrastructure.
  3. **The loser learns it lost.** After publishing, the writer re-reads the
     pointer; if the newest head is not its own, it reports `:published?
     false` rather than believing it won.

  What it does NOT buy, and the profile says so: **agreement**. A signature
  proves who issued a head, not that no one else issued another. Two writers
  racing still fork; this makes the fork visible instead of silent. So the
  declared profile is `:single-writer-ref`, and a correct deployment still
  puts one writer in front of it — a Durable Object, an actor, a lease.
  Declaring `:linearizable-ref` here would be exactly the silent-success
  failure `ref-profiles` exists to prevent."

  Both halves are the difference between checking a signature and checking
  authority, and both were missing until 2026-08-04:

  **The ref name.** `read-head!` is documented as reading from a host that is
  not trusted — that is the whole premise. `\"ref\"` is inside the signed
  record, but nothing compared it to the name actually being read, so the same
  host could answer a read for ref B with ref A's genuinely-signed head and it
  verified. A reader then gets ref A's CID under ref B: not corruption the
  signature can catch, because nothing was forged.

  **The issuer.** `verify-fn` is called with the issuer the record NAMES, so
  the check was \"somebody signed this\", which any keypair satisfies. An
  untrusted host substituting a head signed by its own key passed. Verifying a
  signature by an unconstrained issuer is not evidence about an untrusted
  host, and untrusted hosting is precisely what this namespace claims to buy."

  The pointer can be anything that stores bytes under a name without
  conditions: an S3 PUT, an IPNS publish, a file. That is the point — the host
  is not being asked for a guarantee it cannot give.

  **`:accept-issuer?` defaults to strict, and that is a behaviour change as of
  2026-08-04.** Reads previously accepted a head signed by ANY issuer the
  record happened to name, which makes the signature check say only \"somebody
  signed this\" — no evidence at all against the untrusted host this namespace
  is built for. The documented deployment model is one writer per ref, so its
  own `:issuer` is the right default. A deployment that rotated signing
  identities, or hands a ref between issuers on purpose, passes its own
  predicate (e.g. `#(contains? known-issuers %)`) — which is then a stated
  decision rather than the absence of one."
