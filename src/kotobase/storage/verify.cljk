  "CID verification as a property of the STORE, not of each caller.

  The block plane is deliberately hostable on infrastructure nobody trusts:
  `core.cljc` says blocks may live \"anywhere that can hold immutable bytes
  (including untrusted, erasure-coded, content-addressed networks)\". That is
  only sound if somebody re-hashes what comes back. Today nobody does it in
  one place — the check is re-implemented at half a dozen call sites, and it
  is MISSING on the two hottest read paths in the fleet (the prolly-tree's
  `get-node` and the peer Worker's `get-node!` both decode bytes straight
  from the store). A decorator moves the check to the seam every read already
  crosses, so a caller cannot forget it and a new caller inherits it.

  ## The failure policy is to THROW, and that is the opposite of `signed-head`

  `signed-head/verify-chain` treats an unverifiable head as ABSENT: \"an
  untrusted host is expected to be able to serve rubbish, and the caller's
  job is to not believe it.\" That is right THERE and wrong HERE, and the
  difference is what absence means to the caller.

  - A ref that reads as absent means \"no head published\". The caller's next
    move — publish from genesis, or refuse to proceed — is safe by
    construction. Absence is a state the ref plane genuinely has.

  - A block that reads as absent means \"this node is not here\", and a
    tree walk cannot distinguish that from \"this subtree does not exist\".
    Omitting a tampered block would turn a corrupt store into a SHORTER
    ANSWER: rows quietly missing from a query result, with no error anywhere
    and nothing in the result to say the store lied. It would also be
    indistinguishable from a plain cache miss, so the retry logic every
    caller already has would paper over an attack.

  Worse, absence of a block is already anomalous in a way absence of a ref
  is not: a CID is only ever asked for because something POINTED at it. So a
  mismatch is not \"the host has nothing\" — it is positive proof that the
  host returned bytes that are not the bytes, and the only honest thing to
  do with proof of a lying host is to stop.

  Hence `:kotobase.storage/cid-mismatch`, thrown, carrying the CID asked for
  and the CID the bytes actually hash to. `classify` is provided for the one
  caller that legitimately wants to survey damage rather than stop on it —
  a scrub or repair pass — so wanting that does not require making the read
  path lenient.

  ## `cid-of` is injected, because this library has no runtime dependencies

  `deps.edn` keeps `io-multiformats` TEST-ONLY on purpose: this namespace
  sits under every provider including Worker builds, and pulling a hashing
  library in here would put `@noble/hashes` in all of them. So the hash
  function arrives as a parameter, `(fn [bytes] cid-string)`, exactly as
  `kotobase/code_graph.cljc` injects its `verify` fn and as `signed-head`
  injects `sign-fn`/`verify-fn`. The caller already has a CID implementation;
  it does not need a second one.

  ## What is delegated, and why the shape is chosen at construction

  The decorator is built by `verifying-block-store`, which returns a value
  implementing `IRefStore` **only when the wrapped store does**. Always
  implementing it would make `storage/ref-store?` — and therefore
  `backend?` and `validate-backend!` — answer true for a block-only store
  wrapped here, which is a worse lie than the one it avoids. Never
  implementing it would silently strip the ref plane off a full backend, so
  wrapping a working backend would break its refs. Deciding at construction
  is the only option where `satisfies?` keeps telling the truth.

  `-capabilities` delegates and adds `:verified-blocks`, so \"reads through
  this store are checked\" is discoverable the same way every other
  guarantee in this contract is, rather than being a fact about how the
  store happened to be assembled.

  `-put-blocks!` is NOT verified. The threat model is a host returning bytes
  you did not write; the bytes on a put came from this process. A caller that
  computes its own CIDs wrongly builds a store that now fails its OWN reads,
  loudly, which is the same defect surfacing at the same seam without paying
  to hash every write twice.

  The large-object plane (`kotobase.storage.object`) is out of scope: it
  moves bytes the process never holds (`:presigned-transfer`), so its
  integrity check belongs at the transfer, not here.

  ## Sync and async are separate decorators

  `-get-blocks` returns a map on the JVM and a Promise on Worker providers
  (`core/async-ports`, `async_contract.cljs`). Verification cannot straddle
  that, so there are two: `verifying-block-store` and, on ClojureScript,
  `async-verifying-block-store`. The sync one detects a Promise-returning
  store and says which to use instead, rather than hashing a Promise object
  and reporting every block as tampered."
