  "Two substrates disagreeing about one row, and what it takes to notice.

  The two `scan` implementations below are not invented for the test. Their
  bound predicates are lifted verbatim from the two range APIs in this
  workspace, measured 2026-09-06:

      prolly-tree.core/scan-range       (neg? (compare k hi))
      kotobase.projection/decode-range  (not (pos? (compare k upper)))

  They differ on exactly one key -- the one equal to the upper bound -- which
  is why a facade that took either as `range` would return a different row set
  depending on which substrate answered, with nothing in the result saying so."
