  "Async conformance suite, verified against its own oracles.

  The JVM half races real threads, so interleaving is guaranteed. The async
  half races promises on one event loop, where it is NOT: if every
  `-read-ref` resolved before any write ran, four writers would serialize
  and the race would pass trivially against a store enforcing nothing. So
  this file does not merely run the suite -- it runs it against stores that
  must be REJECTED, and requires the rejection to come from the check that
  is supposed to catch each one.

  The store that matters is `:toctou`. It is sequentially correct -- it
  passes every check the old suite had -- and wrong only under concurrent
  writers, because it decides on a value it read a turn earlier and writes
  without re-checking. That is not a contrived shape: it is read-then-PUT
  over HTTP, which is what a provider without a conditional write can
  offer, and it is what the old suite could never distinguish from a real
  precondition."
